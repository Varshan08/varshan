            <h1>Projects i've worked on</h1>
            <p>1. Heart Disease Prediction App
                This project is an AI-driven application designed to assist in the early diagnosis of heart disease by leveraging machine learning and generative AI models. Built with Gradio for an intuitive user interface, the app analyzes patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other critical parameters to predict the likelihood of heart disease. A pre-trained deep learning model provides accurate predictions, while an advanced language model generates detailed diagnostic reports, offering insights into symptoms, causes, and preventive measures. This project highlights expertise in AI, data preprocessing, and full-stack application development, making it a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners and patients.
                
                2. Engine Shut-Off Sensor
                This innovative project focuses on enhancing vehicle safety and energy efficiency by developing an automatic engine shut-off system. The system utilizes sensors to detect conditions such as prolonged idling or environmental triggers and automatically shuts down the engine to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The project involved integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and real-time decision-making algorithms to ensure reliability and efficiency. This solution demonstrates strong skills in embedded systems, hardware-software integration, and an understanding of sustainable technology.
                
                3. Automatic Door Locking System Using Arduino
                This project aims to improve home and office security by designing an automatic door locking system using Arduino. The system employs sensors to detect authorized access and controls the locking mechanism accordingly, ensuring secure and automated operation. The project involved programming the Arduino microcontroller, wiring sensors and actuators, and testing the system for efficiency and reliability. This work demonstrates expertise in microcontroller programming, circuit design, and building practical IoT applications for everyday use.</p>
